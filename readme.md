## Description
Created as part of the Esri intern hackathon and earning the 1st Place Award, this is a Chrome browser extension that parses out geographic locations in your active tab and lets you visualize them on a WebGL globe using Esri's JavaScript API. It is intended to visually contextualize page content and enhance geoliteracy with minimal overhead by seamlessly integrating into your daily workflow in Chrome.
